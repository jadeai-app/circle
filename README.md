  Triple-Redundant Notification Channels:

    Primary: Firebase Cloud Messaging (push notifications)

    Secondary: Twilio SMS (within 3 seconds)

    Tertiary: SendGrid email (within 5 seconds)



    Failover Logic:

      - All three channels triggered simultaneously

      - Each channel logs delivery status in Firestore

      - If primary fails, secondary/tertiary already sent (no delay)

      - Delivery confirmation required from at least 2 of 3 channels



  Escalation Protocol (Guardian-Enforced):

    - No response from circle member within 5 minutes ‚Üí Resend notification

    - No response from any circle member within 10 minutes ‚Üí Escalate to backup contacts

    - Critical SOS (user-designated) ‚Üí Also notify pre-configured emergency services liaison



  Offline Resilience:

    - SOS queued locally if network unavailable

    - Service worker monitors connectivity, sends when online

    - Visual indicator shows "SOS queued, will send when connected"

    - Last known location attached even if offline when triggered


Accidental Trigger Prevention (UX Safety):



  Multi-Step Confirmation:

    1. Long-press SOS button (3 seconds) with haptic feedback and visual countdown

    2. Slide-to-confirm action: "Slide right to alert your circle"

    3. 5-second countdown with cancel button (large, accessible)

    4. Final confirmation: "Are you safe? Cancel if accidental."



  False Positive Detection:

    - Machine learning model trained on SOS patterns (time of day, location, frequency)

    - Suspicious patterns (e.g., multiple SOS in rapid succession) trigger extra confirmation

    - User education: "We noticed unusual activity‚Äîis everything okay?"



  Practice Mode:

    - Clearly labeled "PRACTICE SOS" in app menu

    - Sends notifications with "üîî PRACTICE ALERT" prefix

    - Recipients see "This is a practice‚Äî[User] is safe"

Emergency Service Clarity (Legal + Ethical):



  Prominent Disclaimers (Guardian-Validated):

    - Onboarding: Full-screen explanation before first SOS setup

    - SOS button: Subtext always visible: "Alerts your circle‚Äînot 911"

    - Pre-SOS confirmation: "For life-threatening emergencies, call 911 first"

    - Post-SOS screen: "If you need emergency services, tap here to call [local number]"



  Jurisdiction-Appropriate Guidance:

    - Auto-detect user location ‚Üí Display local emergency number (911, 112, 999, etc.)

    - Emergency call button integrates with device dialer (direct call, no app mediation)

    - Language-localized messaging (powered by i18n library)



  Legal Protection:

    - Terms of Service: Clear liability limitations, user responsibility acknowledgment
